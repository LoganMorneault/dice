I play a lot of tabletop RPGs with my friends, so we have a pretty notable need for lots of dice at once. These programs are designed to roll as many wacky dice as you so please.

Part of the fun in making these programs is translating something into multiple different languages. This was very easy in Python but much more complicated in C++, and it's fun to see how implemenations change from language to language.
